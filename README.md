## repo for my contributions to the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/)

### 2023

i lived in the country of georgia for a few years, so i will publish maps about that beautiful place

i aim to create a minimum of ten maps and use the `rayshader` , `stars`, and `magick` packages in R for the first time

### 2024

i work for a civic tech nonprofit focused on voting, so i will publish maps relating to elections

i aim to create a minimum of fifteen maps this year even though work keeps me busy during election season (the u.s. general election falls on day 5: 'a journey')
